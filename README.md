# Introduction to My Library ( Books Page)

- Designed a static website where users can find out about my recommendations of books and info about popular books.

    - Designed a banner section that contains the most popular book that I like using different HTML block, inline elements.

    - Styled the website using CSS3 properties such as background, flex, and CSS box model properties and relative units such as vh, vw, and used absolute units such as px.

- Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
